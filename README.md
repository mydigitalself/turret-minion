Lord Baron von Vader Ham (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv5iEK-IEzw) is a hubot script listening for trouble.

You can also use the following commands that the minions will listen to:
* minions ARISE
* minions to 2 o clock
* minions FIRE AT THE THINGS!
* minions left/right/up/down degrees (e.g. minions left 40 or minions down 20)
