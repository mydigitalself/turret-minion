## Commands

Lord Baron von Vader Ham (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv5iEK-IEzw) is a hubot script listening for trouble.

If anyone says "lordvader trouble in sector 3" in the nodebots room, Lord Vader will instruct the minions to deal with the situation.

You can also use the following commands that the minions will listen to:
* minions ARISE
* minions to 2 o clock
* minions FIRE AT THE THINGS!
* minions pan/tilt degrees (e.g. minions tilt 40 or minions pan 20)
